# Recent

<em> Deciphering many-body dynamics in mesoscopic quantum gases - </em>


<em>Saturday of Theoretical Physics - </em> In March 2024 I presented at Oxford's Morning of Theoretical Physics, an outreach event for alumni to learn about current research in the department. A podcast of the event is available <a href="https://saturdaytheory.physics.ox.ac.uk/event/leverhulme-peierls-fellows-0" target="_blank">here</a>.

<em> Jets and thermalization in non-abelian plasmas - </em> I organized the first week of the 2021 Institute for Nuclear Theory program "Probing QCD at high energy and density with jets".

<em> CERN-Fermilab School - </em>I was on the local organizing committee for the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1023573/" target="_blank">2021 CERN-Fermilab Hadron Collider Physics Summer School</a>.

In February 2021 I organized a workshop with Aleksas Mazeliauskas and Wilke van der Schee on the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/975877/" target="_blank">Opportunities of oxygen--oxygen and proton--oxygen collisions at the LHC.</a> The workshop had 400 registered participants and 186 unique connections per day. We wrote <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01939" target="_blank">arXiv:2103.01939</a> to summarize the scientific content of the workshop.
