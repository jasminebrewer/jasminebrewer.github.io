# OppO@LHC
In February 2021 I organized a workshop with Aleksas Mazeliauskas and Wilke van der Schee on the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/975877/" target="_blank">Opportunities of oxygen--oxygen and proton--oxygen collisions at the LHC.</a> The workshop had 400 registered participants and 186 unique connections per day. We wrote <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01939" target="_blank">arXiv:2103.01939</a> to summarize the scientific content of the workshop.
