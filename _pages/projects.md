## Data inference with jets

A major focus of my research is developing techniques to use large and complex data most directly to access the properties of the plasma. My research focuses on using jets - sprays of high-energy particles produced inside the quark-gluon plasma. However, jets themselves are very complicated objects, so my research focuses on identifying special types of analysis techniques or physical processes where we can access new information using data.


#### Jets with two charm quarks

Jets containing two charm quarks provide a unique opportunity to connect theory to experiment, by making it possible to directly access the underlying gluon splitting to charm quarks. These processes allow us to access physics that cannot be accessed in other processes, including medium-enhanced charm production we demonstrated in <a href="" target="_blank"> </a> and <a href="" target="_blank"> </a>.

#### Disentangling quark and gluon jets

Jets come in two types - they can be initiated either by quarks or gluons - which give them different properties and influence their interaction with the quark-gluon plasma. Separating measurements into quark and gluon jets can be viewed as a topic modelling problem. Two unlabelled mixtures of two underlying categories, in this case quark and gluon jets, can be separated into measurements on each category. I demonstrated this technique for separating quark and gluon jet measurements in heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrated the technique for the first time in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08596" target="_blank">arXiv:2008.08596</a> and showed how it can be used for a variety of observables in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00641" target="_blank">arXiv:2204.00641</a>. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/jasminebrewer/jet-topics-from-MCMC" target="_blank">github</a>.
